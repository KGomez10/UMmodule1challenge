# Kickstarter Challenge


**Overview of Project**

The purpose of this analysis was to help make Louise’s’ Kickstarter data from her project campaign more readable and searchable with the help of Excel tools by filtering using the four main categories in the Outcome column—Successful, Failed, Canceled.

**Analysis and Challenges**

The analysis was performed using line charts and bar charts that compared outcomes based on launch dates and goals. These charts provided feedback on data such as comparison by Years, Goal outcomes for Theater criteria set by Months, Failed pledges as well as Successful US Pledges, even descriptive statistics that provided the Mean and Median of the Successful vs Failed goals. The data that was able to be collected using the charts specified about gave a better understanding on whether the timeframe of the goals needed to for a longer period, whether the goals were better reached in the US vs elsewhere and data such as which of the campaigns performed best and during which months they performed best.

One of the challenges I ran into was determining the Mean and Median and its formula. Even though with Excels system, I was able to successful enter the formula provided by Excel to gain more information about the data set and/or the set of values.


**Results**

**-What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?**

Based on the information and data collected from the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date charts, two conclusions I was able to draw out are the following:

- May -June were the highest successful goal rate months. As viewed on the line graph, during these months is where the line graph spiked. As well as being one of the successful goal rate months, the month of May also had the highest goal failed rate of (52). This data proves that though the middle months were successful, it also brought higher cancellations. 

- The lowest goal successes were in the month December (37). The month with the highest cancellations was in January (7). Interesting data collected is that in the month of October there were no cancellations, yet it did have a rather high failed rate of (50).

**-What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**

Based on the data collected on the “Outcomes based on Goals” table were the following:

- Highest successful goal percentage of 76% were for goals that were set to be less than $1000. Even though goals set to be within 1000-4999 were higher, their failed percentage was the highest bringing down the success percentage to 73%.

- We were able to confirm that the higher the set goal rate, the less the success percentage. We can confirm this information by viewing the looking at the drop on the line chart for goals within 45000 to 49999


- Another conclusion collected by this data is that miraculously there were no cancellations for the goals set for the subcategory of “Plays”.

**-What are some limitations of this dataset?**

Limitations that were found based on the range of currency. There is a wide range of different types of currency that makes it difficult to get a better analysis of the outcomes. 

**-What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**

Some of other possible tables and graphs that could be created are the following:

•	Tables comparing the most successful categories by currency.

•	Tables comparing launch/deadline along with filtering by Country 

•	Charts comparing Pledges against Goals, filtering by Country and Year.

•	Graphs showing Average Donations by Country filtered by timeframe.
